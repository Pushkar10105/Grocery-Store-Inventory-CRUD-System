# Grocery-Store-Inventory-CRUD-System

This is my first GitHub repository. I am developing a Grocery Store Inventory CRUD System using Python and CSV.



This project is made by Pushkara Bhardwaj , Registration no:-25BCY10105



This is a simple Grocery Store Inventory Management System built using Python.

It performs basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on products using a CSV file for data storage.



##### **I have made this project with the understanding of the following topics**:-



1)Python functions



2)File handling



3)CSV module



4)Basic Git and GitHub usage



#### **The Tasks that can be performed by this project are**:-



a)Add new products



b) View all products



c)Update existing products



d) Delete products



#### **How to Run the Project (Step-by-Step)**



Follow these steps carefully to avoid any directory or file path errors.



##### **Step 1:-**



Make sure Python is installed on your system.



Check using by running the below code on command prompt:-

python --version



If Python is not installed, download it from:

https://www.python.org



###### **Step 2:-**

You can either:



Download ZIP from GitHub and extract it

OR



Clone it using Git command on the command prompt:-

git clone https://github.com/Pushkar10105/Grocery-Store-Inventory-CRUD-System.git



###### **Step 3:-**

Open the Project Folder



Navigate into the project folder (Run the below command in the cmd to go into the project folder):-

cd Grocery-Store-Inventory-CRUD-System



Then go into the sub folder:-

cd source\_code

###### 

###### **Step 4:-**

finally you can run the project typing the below command in the cmd:-

python main.py



###### **NOTE:-**

**This project uses the following line in storage.py to access the data file:**

INVENTORY\_FILE = os.path.join("..", "data", "inventory.csv")



This means the program expects:



main.py and storage.py to stay inside the source\_code folder



inventory.csv to stay inside the data folder



Therefore, you must run the program from inside the source\_code folder, otherwise Python will not find the CSV file.
